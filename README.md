# CS3251-devcontainer

A dev container for PA1 in CS3251, using Ubuntu 18.04 and Python 3.6.

Tested on linux/x86_64 (aka AMD64).

Using a Mac with an ARM (M1/M2) chip? See the [arm64 branch](https://github.com/avannus/CS3251-devcontainer/tree/arm64)

After cloning / private forking this, open this directory in VSCode with the DevContainers extension, and make sure Docker is running.

Either hit the "Reopen in Container" popup on the bottom right, hit the same from the bottom left blue "Remote Window" button, or just run the command "remote-containers.openFolder"
